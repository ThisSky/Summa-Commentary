  name={Name},
  description={
    A term used to signify the essence or nature of a thing.
    In metaphysics, to name something is to attempt to signify
    what it is. When angels reveal their names, this indicates
    their office or function: Raphael signifies God's healing,
    and Michael signifies the question “Who is like God?”
    God, however, cannot be named according to His essence,
    since His essence exceeds the comprehension of the created
    intellect. Nevertheless, we apply names to God analogically,
    according to the perfections found in creatures.
